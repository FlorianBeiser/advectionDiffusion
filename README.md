# advectionDiffusion
Advection diffusion model as analytical example for Kalman filtering and ensembles with localisation.

## Acknowledgement
The example and the original code is taken from the work of Gunhild Berget (NTNU). 

## Content
Investigation of localisation in ensemble-based data assimilation by means of the advection diffusion equation, where the analytical solution of the Kalman filter is accesible. 

## Requirements
We recommend the use of a conda environment with Python 3.8 (tested) and the following packages
- jupyter 
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- statsmodels
